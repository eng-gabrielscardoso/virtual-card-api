## Installation

### Local

1. Firstly you need to install the system required packages. If you are running on a Unix system, you could run the following command to install the required packages. If you are running on a Windows system or another you could search about the dependencies separated and install each one.

```bash
chmod +x install-system-requirements.sh && sudo ./install-system-requirements.sh
```

2. After install the system required packages, you must run the following command to install the Laravel required packages.

```bash
composer install
```

3. By now your application has the necessary dependencies, but still not operating. Copy the `.env.example` file as `.env` and run the following command to generate the app key.

```bash
php artisan key:generate
```

4. Run the following command to run the migrations using artisan:

```bash
php artisan migrate
```

5. Run the following command to generate some fake data for testing purposes

```bash
php artisan db:seed
```

6. Finally, run the following command to serve the API

```bash
php artisan serve
```

### Sail (Docker)

1. Copy the `.env.example` file as `.env`. You could run the API using Laravel Sail. For it, just setup the following alias into your local `.bashrc` file:

```bash
alias sail='[ -f sail ] && sh sail || sh vendor/bin/sail'
```

2. Now, run the following command to up the containers

```bash
sail up -d
```

3. By now your application has the necessary dependencies, but still not operating. Run the following command to generate the app key.

```bash
sail artisan key:generate
```

4. Run the following command to run the migrations using artisan:

```bash
sail artisan migrate
```

5. Run the following command to generate some fake data for testing purposes

```bash
sail artisan db:seed
```

And then, your API will be up and running.
